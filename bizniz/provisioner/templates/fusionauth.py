"""
FusionAuth infrastructure template.

FusionAuth is the project's default OAuth/OIDC provider. The template
emits:

  - docker-compose service entry (depends on postgres)
  - kickstart.json that pre-configures a tenant, application, roles, an
    initial admin user, and OAuth redirect URLs derived from the project's
    frontend service
  - .env entries for FusionAuth admin password, API key, app id, and
    issuer URL the application services use

The kickstart file is FusionAuth's bootstrapping format — it executes
the listed REST requests once on first start, creating the realm
configuration without any manual UI clicks. Kickstart docs:
